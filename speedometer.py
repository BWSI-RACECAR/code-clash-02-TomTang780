Code Clash #2 - Bill's Speedometer (speedometer.py)


Author: Paul Thai

Difficulty Level: 2/10

Background: Bill is driving his brand new car down the street. Every 5 minutes, 
a special instrument records the current speed on his speedometer. After X minutes 
the instrument stops and all the speed recorded is stored into an array (python list). 

Prompt: Given an array of Bill's different speed, the target speed is given at
random.  Traverse through the array and find two numbers that add up to the total speed. 
If the two elements are found, return the two position of the elements as a list. 
If there are no elements that add to the value of the total speed, return false. 

Constraints: N/A

Test Cases:
Input: ary = [1,2,3,4,5] ; target = 6 ;     Output = [0,4]
Input: ary = [2,7,11,15] ; target = 18 ;    Output = [1,2]
Input: ary = [3,1,7] ; target = 4 ;         Output = [0,1]
